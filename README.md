## Research Focus
My research primarily explores efficient methods for variable selection in high-dimensional data settings. The main techniques I focus on include:

- **Lasso Regression:**  
  Using Lasso regression to perform both variable selection and regularization, thereby enhancing model interpretability and preventing overfitting.
  
- **Elastic Net Regularization:**  
  Combining the benefits of Lasso and Ridge regression, the elastic net helps address issues with correlated predictors while maintaining robust variable selection.
