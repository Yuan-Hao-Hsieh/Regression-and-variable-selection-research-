## Research Focus
My research primarily explores efficient methods for variable selection in high-dimensional data settings. The main techniques I focus on include:

- **Ridge Regression:**  
  Ridge regression introduces an L2 penalty to the loss function, shrinking coefficient estimates to reduce variance and mitigate multicollinearity. Our research examines its ability to stabilize model predictions, especially in complex datasets where predictors are highly correlated.
  
- **Lasso Regression:**  
  Using Lasso regression to perform both variable selection and regularization, thereby enhancing model interpretability and preventing overfitting.
  
- **Elastic Net Regularization:**  
  Combining the benefits of Lasso and Ridge regression, the elastic net helps address issues with correlated predictors while maintaining robust variable selection.

- **Least Angle Regression (LARS):**  
  LARS is a computationally efficient algorithm designed for model selection in scenarios with a large number of predictors. By iteratively identifying the variable most correlated with the residual, LARS provides a path to sparse model solutions. Our investigations aim to compare its performance with traditional methods and explore its role in effective regularization.
